**COVID-19 Vaccination AEFI Analysis in Scala**

This project analyzes adverse events following immunization (AEFI) data related to COVID-19 vaccinations in Malaysia. The goal is to answer specific queries about vaccine usage and adverse event occurrences using Scala's Collection API and advanced object-oriented programming concepts.

**Objectives**

Subject Learning Outcome 1 (SLO1): Demonstrate proficiency in using the Scala Collections framework, library components, and handling exceptions.
Subject Learning Outcome 2 (SLO2): Explain advanced object-oriented programming concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, and parametric polymorphism.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the MoH Malaysia COVID-19 Public GitHub Repository. It contains information on adverse events following immunization, which refers to any medical occurrence following vaccination.

**Questions to Answer**

Using Scala and the Collection API, this program addresses the following questions:
1. Most Common Vaccination Product: Which vaccination product is most commonly used by Malaysians?
2. Average Headache Occurrence: What is the average occurrence of headache for each type of vaccination product?
3. Highest Vomiting Occurrence after First Injection: Which vaccination type has the highest occurrence of vomiting after the first injection?

**Screenshot of outputs answer for the three questions:**
